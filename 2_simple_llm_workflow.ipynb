      "{'question': 'How far is Moon from Earth?', 'answer': 'Of course! Here is a detailed answer to your question.\\n\\nThe short answer is that the **average distance** from the Earth to the Moon is about:\\n\\n*   **384,400 kilometers**\\n*   **238,855 miles**\\n\\nHowever, the Moon\\'s distance from Earth is not constant because its orbit is not a perfect circle; it\\'s an ellipse.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### A More Detailed Look\\n\\nHere are the key distances to understand the Moon\\'s orbit:\\n\\n#### 1. Perigee (Closest Point)\\nWhen the Moon is at its closest point to Earth, it is at **perigee**. The distance is approximately:\\n*   **363,300 km (225,700 miles)**\\n*   A full moon at perigee is often called a **\"Supermoon\"** because it can appear slightly larger and brighter than usual.\\n\\n#### 2. Apogee (Farthest Point)\\nWhen the Moon is at its farthest point from Earth, it is at **apogee**. The distance is approximately:\\n*   **405,500 km (252,000 miles)**\\n*   A full moon at apogee can be called a **\"Micromoon.\"**\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Fun Facts to Put the Distance in Perspective\\n\\n*   **Light Travel Time:** It takes light from the Moon approximately **1.3 seconds** to reach Earth.\\n\\n*   **Fitting All the Planets:** At its average distance, you could fit all the other planets in our solar system (Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) side-by-side in the space between the Earth and the Moon.\\n\\n*   **Travel Time:** If you could drive a car at a constant speed of 100 km/h (62 mph), it would take you about **160 days** to reach the Moon.\\n\\n### Is the Distance Changing?\\n\\nYes! Scientists have measured that the Moon is slowly moving away from Earth at a rate of about **3.8 centimeters (1.5 inches) per year**. This is due to the tidal interactions between the two bodies.'}\n"
